# slimrb-ripoff 

#### Description
slimrb-ripoff is a PHP package that attempts to mimic some of the unique qualities of slimrb. 

#### How it's done
We use a Recursive Descent Parser to process the view's language grammar and then generate a PHP file from this intermediate syntax. Parsing only occurs once unless the file has been modified. 

#### Is it on packagist yet?
Unfortunately, no. The only way to use this code (at the moment) is to clone this repo.
