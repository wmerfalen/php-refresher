# rdp-view-system

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wmerfalen/rdp-view-system.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/wmerfalen/rdp-view-system)

#### Current Version
1.1

#### Description
A PHP package that attempts to mimic some of the unique qualities of slimrb. 

#### How it's done
We use a Recursive Descent Parser (hence the 'rdp' in this repo's title) to process the view's language grammar and then generate a PHP file from this intermediate syntax. Parsing only occurs once unless the file has been modified. 

# Syntax
#### Indentation
Indentation is required to open and close tags. 
```
html
	body
		div|This is a div
			p|this is a paragraph
```
The above code will generate the following html:
```
<html><body><div>This is a div<p>this is a paragraph</p></div></body></html>
```
#### Whitespace
The generated html is devoid of tab formatting to minimize memory footprint.
#### Literals
Literal strings start with the pipe character. 
```
html
	body
		div|This is a literal string
```
#### Variables
Embedding variables is very similar to most webdev frameworks
```
html
	body
		{{$my_attributes}}
		div|This is a div
```
The HTML that is generated by the above code snippet is dependant largely on what is in the variable $my_attributes.
